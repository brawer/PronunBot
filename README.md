# PronunBot

PronunBot is a tool for uploading a batch of recorded pronunciations
to [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/) and
[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org).

## Background

We‚Äôve built this tool at a [Plurilinguism
Hackathon](https://forum-helveticum.ch/en/hackathon/) in November
2018.  [Lia Rumantscha](http://www.liarumantscha.ch/?changeLang=_en)
contributed about 5000 recorded pronunciations in the [Sursilvan
variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sursilvan_dialects_(Romansh))
of the [Romansh
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romansh_language) to the
hackathon. The pronunciations had been recorded back in 2007 as
language training material; at the hackathon, Lia Rumantscha kindly
gave permission to upload them to Wikidata under the Creative Commons Zero
license.


## Setup

We‚Äôve used a Macintosh laptop with
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) running a
Linux container. For setup instructions, see the comments in `Dockerfile`.


## Splitting multi-word phrases

In our project, many of the original recordings are multi-word phrases.
An example is the phrase [‚Äújeu savess prender‚Äù](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/brawer/PronunBot/testdata/split_phrases/jeu%20savess%20prender.mp3). Because
the recording was done for language training, the words are often
separated by a brief span of silence; this is rather unusual in recorded
speech.

However, for using the sound snippets in Wikidata lexemes, we need
a separate sound snippet for every word. The tool `split_phrases.py`
goes over the input files, calls [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
to detect silences, and then applies a simple heuristic to split the
sound file into single words.  Finally, the tool will tag each snippet
with metadata (such as license, performer, or language) and compress
the sound in the lossless [FLAC format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC).

To run the splitting script, we‚Äôve used the following command inside
the Linux container:

```
python split_phrases.py -o split  \
  --language=rm-sursilv --date=2007-03-09  \
  --performer="Erwin Ard√ºser"  \
  --organization="Lia Rumantscha, Conradin Klaiss"  \
  --license="Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal"  \
  /recordings
```

Some recordings, for example the phrase [bien
di üîâ](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/brawer/PronunBot/testdata/split_phrases/bien%20di.mp3),
do not have enough silent spans for splitting the phrase into
words. The tool logs the problem cases in `split-failures.txt`,
located inside the output directory.
